Methods:
public void main(String[] args)
Creates a JFrame holding a JScrollpane, JTextArea and JTextfield. These are the I/O of the program.  Once initialized, the program will wait for the user to put an absolute URL in the text area. It will then create a xmlVerifier, which starts the validation.  This method also checks if the files specified by the user actually exist before passing them along to the xmlVerifier.
